# {{PROJECT_NAME}}

{{DESCRIPTION}}

## Template: TheSereyn.Templates.MinimalApi

Back-end only template for .NET projects with Minimal APIs, Worker Services, and shared contracts.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) or [Podman](https://podman.io/)
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [Dev Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)

### First-Time Setup

1. Click **"Use this template"** on GitHub to create your new repository
2. Clone your new repo and open it in VS Code
3. When prompted, click **"Reopen in Container"**
4. Once the container is built, run the **first-time-setup** prompt:
   - Open Copilot Chat
   - Type: `@workspace /first-time-setup`
   - Follow the prompts to configure your project identity

### What's Included

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Dev Container** | .NET 10, Node 22, GitHub CLI, Azure CLI, Docker-outside-of-Docker |
| **MCP Servers** | Microsoft Learn, Azure, GitHub |
| **Copilot Skills** | TUnit testing, project conventions, requirements gathering, Playwright CLI |
| **Business Analyst Agent** | Structured 10-phase requirements-gathering interview |
| **Squad** | AI development team (auto-installed via DevContainer) |
| **Code Quality** | StyleCop, .editorconfig, nullable reference types |

### Recommended Workflow

1. **Run first-time-setup** to configure project identity and verify environment
2. **Start with the Business Analyst** — `@Business Analyst` in Copilot Chat to generate requirements
3. **Use Squad** to design architecture and scaffold the solution
4. **Build iteratively** using the included skills and conventions

## Architecture

This template is designed for **back-end only** projects following **Clean Architecture**:

```
src/
├── Domain/           # Entities, value objects, domain events, interfaces
├── Application/      # Use cases, commands, queries, handlers, DTOs
├── Infrastructure/   # Database repos, external service clients, messaging
├── Api/              # ASP.NET Core Minimal API endpoints, DI composition root
├── Worker/           # Background processing with BackgroundService
└── Shared/           # Contracts, DTOs shared between projects
```

## Development

```bash
# Build
dotnet build

# Test (TUnit on Microsoft Testing Platform)
dotnet test

# Run the API
dotnet run --project src/YourProject.Api/
```

## Key Conventions

- **API Style:** Minimal APIs with REPR pattern (one endpoint per file)
- **Error Handling:** RFC 9457 Problem Details for all errors
- **Testing:** TUnit on Microsoft Testing Platform (NOT xUnit/NUnit)
- **Pagination:** Cursor-based for all list endpoints
- **Observability:** OpenTelemetry (traces, metrics, logs)

See the `project-conventions` and `tunit-testing` skills for detailed guidance.
